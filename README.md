# Fire_detection
As a Group project, I worked on implementing a fire alarm using a prebuilt model. 
The code makes use of `cv2.CascadeClassifier()` function and a model trained on positive and negative fire images. 
This project was a part of a research to detect and identify forest fires as early as possible for effective mitigation.
